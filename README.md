## Development

### Quick Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. From the command line, run:
  - `$ bundle install`
  - `$ rake db:create`
  - `$ rake db:migrate`

### Rails Admin
This project uses Rails Admin for database entry. To set up your admin username and password, see the `.env.example` file in the project root folder. 

### Testing
Run the Rails tests with:
```bash
$ rake
```

## Production

### Heroku Setup
This setup assumes you have a version of the app in a GitHub repository.

1. [Create a new app from the Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/new)
2. Under the deploy section of the newly created app dashboard:
  - create a new pipeline
  - connect the app to github
3. Go to the new pipeline you just created:
  - enable review apps
  - enable automatic deployment from master branch

### Setup DNS with SSL on Heroku
1. [Add an alias record to your domain](https://support.dnsimple.com/articles/domain-apex-heroku/#point-using-alias) (we use DNSimple)
2. [Purchase an SSL certificate](https://dnsimple.com/ssl-certificates)
3. [Add the SSL cert to Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-endpoint#setting-up-ssl-on-heroku)
4. [configure the app to force ssl](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/ssl-for-rails-with-heroku-and-dnsimple#prepare-rails-app)

### Debugging
In production, [Rails doesn't send errors to stdout by default](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/logging#writing-to-your-log). To get those errors sent to the heroku log, `config/environments/development.rb` has been modified with `config.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)`. With this configuration in place, use the heroku toolbelt to get runtime errors:
```bash
$ heroku logs --tail --app app-name
```
